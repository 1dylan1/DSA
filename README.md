**Maximum Spanning Tree (MaximumST)**

maximumST is a function that should take an n ×n vector (representing the adjacency matrix of a graph) as input and return the value
of the maximum spanning tree of the graph defined by the n ×n vector.

**Floyd's Algorithm (FloydsAlgorithm)**

A function that should take an n × n vector (representing the adjacency matrix of a
graph) and a value i between 1 and n as input and return the n × n vector representing the matrix
computed after the ith stage of Floyd’s algorithm. For the purposes of this program, infinity (∞)
will be represented as −1
